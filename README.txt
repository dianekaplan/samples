Code samples: 

1. lcsm.java- my approach to Rosalind.org problem to find the longest common substring in a collection of sequences:  http://rosalind.info/problems/lcsm/

2. orf_finder_program.py- this is the simplest and is independently runable.  
The program is adapted from one of my homework problems, to take a DNA sequence and determine the open reading frames (aka ORFs, the part of the sequence that can be transcribed into proteins). I find the ORFs for the three distinct reading frames on both stands of the DNA. 

3. find_splice_functions.py- there are more steps involved here, and these were helper functions for my class project (and not independently runable)- to strip out introns from a DNA sequence and return the cleaned string.
